R peak detection in ECGs using stationary wavelet transform

This is a tutorial notebook that uses Python code and numpy to detect R peaks in ECG signals. Then, given an annotation file, calculates Sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value. It is currently only compatible with MiT-BiH arrhythmia DB signal format. The signals are loaded using the physionet's WFDB python library.
